# Welcome to My Game Of Life
 
 There are two modes that can be played. The first mode begins directly with the cells randomly drawn out across the scene. The second mode allows the player to manually draw the cells into the scene wherever they so chose. Both functions are found in the Start() function with the names InitialRandomGame() and the other InitialSelfDrawGame(). Note that one must be commented out for the other to work.
 
 
## Controls
 
 The following controls work for **BOTH** game modes:
 - P - pause
 - Up & Down arrows - increase/decrease framerate
 - Mouse scroll - zoom in/out
 
 The following control is for the **Self Draw Game ONLY**
- Space - begins the game of life when the player feels it is time to do so after placing the cells in the desired location across the scene. Note: there is no min/max limits to the number of cells that can be placed.
   
 ## Colours
 
 This Game Of Life is coloured to reflect the ages of the cells. 
 - Yellow - cell birth
 - Light Green - young cells
 - Dark Green - adult cells
 - Brown - over the hill cells
 - Brownish Grey - old to ancient cells (depending on how long the game goes)
